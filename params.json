That's why we should be taking down roadblocks to voting.  We believe in an America where everybody can make their voices heard.\r\n\r\nThat is why the Democratic National Committee created this open source application to provide more opportunities to register to vote in November!  States have varying laws for voter registration, so this application is a one stop shop that contains all the voter registration information and voting checklists that you will need to vote. **This information should not be altered.**\r\n\r\nYou can help all eligible voters register to vote by using this software.\r\n\r\n# What is it?\r\n\r\nA Ruby on Rails Application that generates a [National Voter Registration Form](http://www.eac.gov/voter_resources/register_to_vote.aspx) PDF from a webform.\r\nIncludes the guidelines for the National Voter Registration form in all states.\r\n\r\n## Demo\r\nYou can see a running version of the application at [http://voter-registration.herokuapp.com/](http://voter-registration.herokuapp.com/)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n1.
